# 🎨 Delete Button Positioning Fix - Complete!

## ✅ **Delete Button Repositioned for Better UX**

I've moved the delete button from being cramped next to the address type tag to a clean, professional position in the top-right corner of each address card.

## 🎯 **What Was Changed**

### **Before (Cramped Layout):**
```html
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: between; align-items: start;">
    <span>Shipping</span>  <!-- Address type tag -->
    <button>🗑️</button>    <!-- Delete button cramped next to tag -->
</div>
```

### **After (Clean Layout):**
```html
<div style="position: relative;">
    <!-- Delete button in top-right corner -->
    <button style="position: absolute; top: 0.75rem; right: 0.75rem;">🗑️</button>
    
    <!-- Address type tag with space -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
        <span>Shipping</span>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Address details with padding to avoid overlap -->
    <div style="padding-right: 3rem;">
        Address content...
    </div>
</div>
```

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements**

### **1. Better Positioning**
- ✅ **Top-right corner** - Delete button positioned absolutely
- ✅ **Proper spacing** - No longer cramped next to type tag
- ✅ **Clear separation** - Address type and delete button have distinct areas

### **2. Enhanced Styling**
- ✅ **Larger button** - Increased padding for better touch targets
- ✅ **Rounded corners** - 8px border-radius for modern look
- ✅ **Box shadow** - Subtle shadow for depth
- ✅ **Hover effects** - Color change and scale animation

### **3. Improved Layout**
- ✅ **Address type tag** - Now has its own dedicated row
- ✅ **Address content** - Padded to avoid overlap with delete button
- ✅ **Better hierarchy** - Clear visual separation of elements

## 🎯 **New Address Card Layout**
